# Working-with-English-Words

This project is a Python-based exploration of English words, analyzing their characteristics and deriving insights using data manipulation techniques. The dataset used in this project is sourced directly from an external GitHub repository, ensuring a rich and varied collection of words for analysis.

## Overview
The project focuses on:
- Calculating various metrics for English words, such as:
  - **Character Count**: The total number of characters in a word.
  - **Alphabetical Value**: The sum of the alphabetical positions of each letter (e.g., `a=1`, `b=2`, ..., `z=26`).
  - **Ratio**: A derived metric (Value divided by Character Count).
- Answering data-driven questions, such as:
  - Which word has the highest Ratio?
  - How many words share the same Ratio?
  - What is the word with the shortest Character Count for a specific Value?

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the following GitHub repository:  
[Popular Words Dataset](https://github.com/dolph/dictionary/blob/master/popular.txt)

### How the Dataset is Used
- The dataset is fetched directly from the external GitHub repository, ensuring it remains up to date with the source.
- The dataset is processed within the Jupyter Notebook to compute additional metrics, such as `Value` and `Ratio`.

## Features
- **Word Dataset**: A large dataset sourced from a public GitHub repository.
- **Custom Metrics**: Calculates metrics like Character Count, Alphabetical Value, and Ratio.
- **Data Exploration**: Includes example questions and answers, such as:
  - Total number of elements in the dataset.
  - Words with specific conditions (e.g., Ratio of 10).
  - Maximum and minimum values for specific metrics.
- **Exercises**: Includes 20 ranked questions, from beginner to advanced, to test and enhance your understanding.

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Processing**:
   - Reads the dataset directly from the GitHub repository.
   - Computes metrics for each word (e.g., Char Count, Value, Ratio).
2. **Analysis**:
   - Filters, sorts, and aggregates data to answer specific questions.
   - Identifies patterns and outliers in the dataset.
3. **Results**:
   - Displays findings in an interactive format using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Example Questions and Answers
Here are some example questions that the project addresses:
1. How many words are there in the dataset?
2. What word has the highest Ratio, and what is the Ratio value?
3. How many words have a Ratio of exactly 10?
4. Of all the words with a Value of 260, which has the lowest Character Count?

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and computation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive exploration and reproducibility.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Required libraries: `pandas`.
